# IBM-HR-Employee_Attrition

Employee Attrition Prediction

📌 Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition using Machine Learning techniques. It predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on factors like job role, salary, work-life balance, and promotions.

🚀 Features
✔️ Data Preprocessing – Cleans and prepares employee data for modeling
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Analyzes key attrition factors using visualizations
✔️ Feature Engineering – Selects important attributes affecting attrition
✔️ Machine Learning Model – Uses classification models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
✔️ Model Evaluation – Assesses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)
